                          <p>There are various types of visas available for Turkey, including tourist e-Visas, work permits, student visas, and residence permits for purposes such as family reunification, employment, or investment through the Citizenship by Investment Program. It is important to identify the visa category that best suits your travel intentions.</p>

                          <p>
                          The Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) and Turkish diplomatic missions abroad handle visa and residence permit applications. Therefore, it is advisable to visit the official Republic of Turkey e-Visa portal or contact the nearest Turkish diplomatic mission for accurate information. Since immigration regulations can change over time, staying informed through official sources is crucial.</p>

              After identifying the appropriate visa category and gathering all required documents, your next step is to arrange an appointment with the Turkish embassy or consulate. For many visitors, the e-Visa system eliminates the need for an in-person interview. Here's how you can proceed:

                  Visit the official website of the Turkish diplomatic mission in your area to learn about the specific application procedures for visas that cannot be obtained online.

              <li class="mb-3 pb-2 border-bottom">

                  For visas requiring in-person applications, contact the diplomatic mission to secure an appointment slot. Since available appointments can be limited, it is advisable to reach out as early as possible.

                  Many nationalities can obtain an e-Visa online, which is typically processed within 24-72 hours. The e-Visa is usually valid for multiple entries over 180 days with stays of up to 90 days. The application process is straightforward and can be completed entirely online.

                  For stays exceeding 90 days, foreign nationals must apply for a residence permit through the Directorate General of Migration Management. Applications are submitted online through the e-ikamet system and followed by an in-person appointment at the local DGMM office within 90 days of arrival.

                  <span class="fw-bold">Financial Guarantees:</span>
                  Turkey requires proof of sufficient funds for your stay - typically evidence of at least $50 per day for tourists. For residence permits, evidence of regular income, bank statements, or sponsorship may be required. For the Citizenship by Investment Program, a minimum real estate investment of $400,000 or a capital investment of $500,000 is required.

                  All applicants for residence permits must obtain Turkish health insurance that meets government requirements. Short-term visitors are strongly advised to have travel health insurance. For longer stays, enrollment in the Turkish Social Security System (SGK) may be required.

              <li class="mb-3">
               <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i>
                  <span class="fw-bold">Processing Timeframes:</span>
                  E-Visas are typically processed within 24-72 hours. Standard visa applications at consulates generally take 3-10 working days. Short-term residence permits take approximately 2-4 weeks, while work permits can take 30-90 days to process. Citizenship by Investment applications typically require 3-6 months for completion.
